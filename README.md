## Back in Action: Diving into JavaScript and the DOM 🚀

After a long break, I'm excited to be back in the world of coding!💻 I'm starting with a refresher on the Document Object Model (DOM), a fundamental concept for making JavaScript interact with web pages.

### What I Learned 💡

🔍 **DOM Basics:**
* The DOM is like a map of your HTML elements.
* It allows JavaScript to access and manipulate HTML elements and styles.
* It's the bridge between HTML and JavaScript.

🛞 **Creation:**
* Browsers create the DOM when they load HTML.
* Each HTML element has a corresponding node in the DOM tree.
* You can interact with and access each node using JavaScript.

🌐 **Web APIs:**
* DOM methods and properties are part of Web APIs, not core JavaScript.
* Web APIs are provided by browsers for tasks like DOM manipulation, timers, and fetching data.

### My Project: Guess My Number! 🎮
To solidify my understanding, I built a fun game called "Guess My Number!".

I'm eager to continue learning and sharing more projects! Stay tuned for updates 🚀 !
